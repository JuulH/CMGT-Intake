# InfiniGolf
InfiniGolf is an endlessly generated golf arcade game where your goal is to shoot the ball into the hole within 3 strokes and continuing for as long as you can.
The different ground types can be of help or work in your disadvantage: sand will increase friction and stone increases the bounciness.

**CONTROLS:**
To shoot the ball, click and hold down anywhere on the screen, and drag your mouse to aim. The ball will shoot in the direction of the line.
